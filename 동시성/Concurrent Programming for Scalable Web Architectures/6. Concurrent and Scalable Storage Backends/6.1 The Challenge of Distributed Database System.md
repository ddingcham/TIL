# Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures  
# 6. Concurrent and Scalable Storage Backends  

## 6.1 The Challenge of Distributed Database Systems  

### Overview  

#### By Scalability, we aim for increasable data capacity and growing read/write throughput of a high degree  
> we need to cope with highly concurrent access at this level as well.  
> level : the application servers in our model handle huge numbers of requests in parallel  

#### Throughtput and capacity increases can only be sustainably achieved by horizontal scale mechanism  
* single database issue  
  > would only be able to scale up to a **certain load**, even with specialized hardware equipment  
  
#### Considerations  
* Data consistency when reading/writing data in our application  
* Dealing with a distributed system, so we must expect failures in advance.  
  > failure of a single node, we still want the overall storage system  
  * to operate seamlessly  
  * maintain its availability  
* Low Latency of operations  


### The CAP Theorem  
> BREWER, Eric A.: Towards robust distributed systems (abstract), :  
> Proceedings of the nineteenth annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing,  
> PODC '00, ACM, New York, NY, USA, 7-  

* **Consistency**  
  > consistent view of data on all nodes of the distributed system  
  * operations have an atomic characteristic  
  * changes are disseminated simultaneously to **all nodes**, yielding the **same results**  
* **Availability**  
  > eventually answer every request(r/w), even in case of failures  
  * narrowed down to **bounded respones in reasonable time**  

* **Partition tolerance**  
  > the system is resilient to message losses between nodes  
  * partition : an arbitrary aplit between nodes of a system // prior properties  
    > resulting in complete message loss in between  
  * **Mechanisms for maintaining consistency must cope with messages losses**  
  * every node of any potential partition must be able to respond to a request  
  

#### You can have at most two of these properties for any shared-data system  
> Brewer  

* "any real system" must trade off the properties and dismiss at least one of them

#### CA - Consistency & Availability : high-availability consistency    
> In case of a partition, these systems may become inconsistent, as we will see soon  

* **Replication side**  
  * for achieving highly available consistency  
  * transaction protocols are applied to ensure consistency  
    > such as the **two-phase commit**  
  * **split brain** scenarios    
    > separation into partitions may lead  
    * **different partitions create conflicting replicas as a result of isolation**  
    
* **Recovering side**  
  > from such scenarios, would require some kind of consensus protocol  
  * Disallowing nodes to service requests **unless a consensus is available**  
    * Converting our CA approach into a CP approach at the sacirifice of availability  
  
* 네트웤 오류에 대한 대처 (Recovering side) 는 대규모 분산 데이터베이스 시스템에 CA 접근방식이 적합하지 않다는 걸 보여줌  
  > CA 모델만으로는 문제 해결이 어렵다는 거임 (쓰면 안되는 게 아님) -> 실패 내성에 대한 추가적인 처리(회복)가 필요  

#### CP - Consistency & Partition Tolerance : enforced consistency    
> CP 접근 방식의 분산 시스템은 강력한 일관성을 보장하는 서비스를 제공  
* Consistency is guaranteed even in the presence of a partition  
* availability cannot be always provided    
  > **Nodes of a partition may not be able to respond to requests**  
  > **as long as they have not yet agreed with other nodes**  
  > that may be temporarily unreachable  

* when consistency must be enforced at any costs  
  * **banking application** : **primary constraint - balance of all accounts**   
  * oftenly, via RDBMS  
  * **Supporting consistent states even in case of network errors**  
    > requires the usage of sophisticated algorithms for quorum and majority decisions  
    * **Paxos protocol**  
      > protocol for solving consensus  
       
#### AP - Availability & Partition Tolerance : eventual consistency  
> (준)실시간으로, 파티션이 발생해도 가용성을 보장하는 서비스  
> 일시적으로, 일관성이 보장되지 않는 노드가 발생할 수 있음  
> 서비스 무중단이 더 중요할 경우  

* 비즈니스에 따라 일시적으로 일관성이 깨지는 것보다 가용성이 훨씬 중요할 수 있음  

* 어플리케이션 레벨의 개발 시에는 일관성이 깨질 일이 없으므로, **실제 운영 시 발생할 수 있는 시나리오를 따로 고려해야 함**  
  > 스테이징 환경  
  
* ex] DNS or web caches  
  > Stale data (host mappings resp / cached responses) 를 잠시동안 허용  
  > 최신 버전(엔트리)이 동기화되기 전까지  

#### Criticism and an Alternative Model to the CAP Theorem  
* PACELC      
  > 트레이드 오프되는 개념들을, **상황별로 세분화해서 선택**  
  * 파티셔닝(P) 상황  
    * 상충 1 : 가용성(A)  
    * 상충 2 : 일관성(C)  
  * 정상(E) 상황  
    * 상충 1 : 지연시간(L)  
    * 상충 2 : 일관성(C)  
  * ex]  
    * PA / CL systems  
    * PA / EL systems
