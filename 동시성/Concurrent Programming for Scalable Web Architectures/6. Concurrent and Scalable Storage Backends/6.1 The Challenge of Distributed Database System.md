# Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures  
# 6. Concurrent and Scalable Storage Backends  

## 6.1 The Challenge of Distributed Database Systems  

### Overview  

#### By Scalability, we aim for increasable data capacity and growing read/write throughput of a high degree  
> we need to cope with highly concurrent access at this level as well.  
> level : the application servers in our model handle huge numbers of requests in parallel  

#### Throughtput and capacity increases can only be sustainably achieved by horizontal scale mechanism  
* single database issue  
  > would only be able to scale up to a **certain load**, even with specialized hardware equipment  
  
#### Considerations  
* Data consistency when reading/writing data in our application  
* Dealing with a distributed system, so we must expect failures in advance.  
  > failure of a single node, we still want the overall storage system  
  * to operate seamlessly  
  * maintain its availability  
* Low Latency of operations  


### The CAP Theorem  
> BREWER, Eric A.: Towards robust distributed systems (abstract), :  
> Proceedings of the nineteenth annual ACM symposium on Principles of distributed computing,  
> PODC '00, ACM, New York, NY, USA, 7-  

* **Consistency**  
  > consistent view of data on all nodes of the distributed system  
  * operations have an atomic characteristic  
  * changes are disseminated simultaneously to **all nodes**, yielding the **same results**  
* **Availability**  
  > eventually answer every request(r/w), even in case of failures  
  * narrowed down to **bounded respones in reasonable time**  

* **Partition tolerance**  
  > the system is resilient to message losses between nodes  
  * partition : an arbitrary aplit between nodes of a system // prior properties  
    > resulting in complete message loss in between  
  * **Mechanisms for maintaining consistency must cope with messages losses**  
  * every node of any potential partition must be able to respond to a request  
  

#### You can have at most two of these properties for any shared-data system  
> Brewer  

* "any real system" must trade off the properties and dismiss at least one of them

#### CA - Consistency & Availability : high-availability consistency    
> In case of a partition, these systems may become inconsistent, as we will see soon  

* **Replication side**  
  * for achieving highly available consistency  
  * transaction protocols are applied to ensure consistency  
    > such as the **two-phase commit**  
  * **split brain** scenarios    
    > separation into partitions may lead  
    * **different partitions create conflicting replicas as a result of isolation**  
    
* **Recovering side**  
  > from such scenarios, would require some kind of consensus protocol  
  * Disallowing nodes to service requests **unless a consensus is available**  
    * Converting our CA approach into a CP approach at the sacirifice of availability  
  
* 네트웤 오류에 대한 대처 (Recovering side) 는 대규모 분산 데이터베이스 시스템에 CA 접근방식이 적합하지 않다는 걸 보여줌  
  > CA 모델만으로는 문제 해결이 어렵다는 거임 (쓰면 안되는 게 아님) -> 실패 내성에 대한 추가적인 처리(회복)가 필요  

#### CP - Consistency & Partition Tolerance : enforced consistency    
> CP 접근 방식의 분산 시스템은 강력한 일관성을 보장하는 서비스를 제공  
* Consistency is guaranteed even in the presence of a partition  
* availability cannot be always provided    
  > **Nodes of a partition may not be able to respond to requests**  
  > **as long as they have not yet agreed with other nodes**  
  > that may be temporarily unreachable  

* when consistency must be enforced at any costs  
  * **banking application** : **primary constraint - balance of all accounts**   
  * oftenly, via RDBMS  
  * **Supporting consistent states even in case of network errors**  
    > requires the usage of sophisticated algorithms for quorum and majority decisions  
    * **Paxos protocol**  
      > protocol for solving consensus  
       
#### AP - Availability & Partition Tolerance : eventual consistency  
> (준)실시간으로, 파티션이 발생해도 가용성을 보장하는 서비스  
> 일시적으로, 일관성이 보장되지 않는 노드가 발생할 수 있음  
> 서비스 무중단이 더 중요할 경우  

* 비즈니스에 따라 일시적으로 일관성이 깨지는 것보다 가용성이 훨씬 중요할 수 있음  

* 어플리케이션 레벨의 개발 시에는 일관성이 깨질 일이 없으므로, **실제 운영 시 발생할 수 있는 시나리오를 따로 고려해야 함**  
  > 스테이징 환경  
  
* ex] DNS or web caches  
  > Stale data (host mappings resp / cached responses) 를 잠시동안 허용  
  > 최신 버전(엔트리)이 동기화되기 전까지  

#### Criticism and an Alternative Model to the CAP Theorem  
* PACELC      
  > 트레이드 오프되는 개념들을, **상황별로 세분화해서 선택**  
  * 파티셔닝(P) 상황  
    * 상충 1 : 가용성(A)  
    * 상충 2 : 일관성(C)  
  * 정상(E) 상황  
    * 상충 1 : 지연시간(L)  
    * 상충 2 : 일관성(C)  
  * ex]  
    * PA / CL systems  
    * PA / EL systems  

### Consistency Models  

* **Consistency is the most defining constraint for our application logic**  
  > we need to consider different consistency models and their impacts on the application  
* Several ditributed database systems allow to fine-tune consistency trade-offs via configuration parameters  
* ex] e-commerce site can tolerate  
  * relaxed consistency guarantees for product ratings and comments  
  * stronger consistency is required for goods in stock and orders  
  
#### ACID  
> transactional behaviour is not solely related to RDBMS, but is also used for other systems  

* general transaction properties  
  > database transactions provide them in order to maintain the validity of data  
  * **Atomicity** : all or nothing  
    > not only a single transaction but, a sequence of operations resp  
  * **Consistency**    
    > 트랜잭션 실행 결과는 항상 valid state   
    > not invalid state  
  * **Isolation**  
    > 트랜잭션의 작업 진행 상황은 다른 트랜잭션에게 transient  
    > isolation level - 얼만큼 투명하게 할 건지  
    > to prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions  
  * **Durability**  
    > 커밋된 트랜잭션의 결과는 충돌/실패 상황에서도 보존 되어야 함  

* Issue : Serial Execution  
  > via strongly adhering to the principles of ACID  
  > decreasing performance in concurrency  
  * A weaker isolation level between transactions is most used mechanism to speed up transactions and their throughput  
    * **repeatable reads**  
    * **read committed**  
    * **read uncommitted**  
  * but, Consistency is still a core property of the ACID model  
    * mutual dependencies of the properties  
      > making it impossible to remove a single property without affecting the others  
    * **The usage of ACID as part of a distributed systems yields the need of distributed transactions**  
      > 공유되고, 복수의 노드에 샤딩된 데이터에 대해  
      > 구축/운영을 위한 비용이 매우 큼  
  * **distributed systems with no global shared state by default**  
    * we cannot inherently have atomic operations on system level  
      > having no global time, no global now  
    * **operations occur at different times on different machines**  
    * global state of the system in turn endangers durability  
    
* **Building distributed systems adhering to the ACID paradigm is a demanding challenge**  
  * requiring complex coordination and synchronization efforts  
    > between all involved nodes  
  * generating considerable communication overhead within the entire system  
  * 이론적으로, 분산 트랜잭션은 가능함  
    > Although it is possible to build such systems  
    > via distributed transaction  
    * **original motivations for using a distributed database system have been mitigated on this path**    
    * **Isolation and Serializability tackle scalability and concurrency**  
  * Considering an alternative model for consistency  
  
#### BASE  
> This **alternative consistency model** is basically the subsumption of  
> properties resulting from a system that provides **availability and partition tolerance**  
> but **no strong consistency**  

* 일관성에 대한 제약을 나눠서 관리  
  * ex] 일관성 제약 준수를 : 당장은 느슨하게 (요구사항이 허용하는 범위 내에서) -> 나중에 엄격하게  
  * weakening ACID by BASE  
    > weakening  
    > all subsequent reads after a write yield the new, updated state  
    > for all clients and on all nodes of the system  
  * **accepting a temporarily inconsistency window**  
    
* fundamental properties for **BASE**  
  * **Basically Available** : availability of the system even in case of failures    
  * **Soft state**  
    : system provide no strong consistency - **clients must accept stale state under certain circumstances**     
  * **Eventually consistent** : in "best effort" manner / as soon as possible    
  
* Application side  
  * **Availability / Scalability are primary objectives at the expense of consistency**    
  
  * impact on the application logic    
    * developer must be aware of the possibility of stale data  
    * however, **favoring availability over consistency has also benefits**        
      * a partial system failure of an ACID system might reject write operations  
        > **forcing the application to handle the data to be written somehow**  
        > expensive tasks  
      * a BASE system in turn might always accept writes, even in case of network failures  
        > they might not be visible for other nodes immediately - **Soft state**          
        
  * **The applicability of relaxed consistency models depends very much on the application requirements**  
    * ex1] strict constraints of balanced accounts for a banking application  
      > do not fit **Eventual Consistency**    
    * ex2] many web applications built around social objects and user interactions  
      > **can actually accept slightly stale data**  
      
      * User might not even realize any kind of inconsistency at all  
        > **When the inconsistency window is on average smaller than**  
        > **the time between request/response cycles of user interactions**  
    
  * more specific variants of eventual consistency for application developers  
    > giving certain types of promises  
    > allowing to reason more easily  
    * **causal consistency** : operations that might have a **causal** relation  
      > ensuring same sequence by all nodes  
    * **read-your-writes consistency**  
      * client will always see the new value after having updated it  
      * never again an older value  
    * **Session consistency** : variant of the **read-your-writes consistency**  
      * Requiring **session affinity** : via shared global state    
      * but can be helpful for developers  
    * **monotonic read consistency**  
      * after a read operation - any subsequent read must not yield older values   
      * Serializing write operations of a single client  
    * **these consistencies can be combined or are subset of others**  
    
* **Eventual Consitency** entails the possibility of data conflicts  
  > **also part of the application logic, not only database system**  
  * decoupling from client operations  
    * on read or write operations  
    * asynchronously in the background
