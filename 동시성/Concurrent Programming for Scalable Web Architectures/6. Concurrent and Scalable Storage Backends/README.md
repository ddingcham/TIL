# Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures  
# 6. Concurrent and Scalable Storage Backends  

## Intro  
#### Some type of persistent state represents an essential part of the overall application  
> edged away state handling to dedicated backend services  

#### impact of concurrency and scalability in storage backends  
* challenge of guaranteeing consistency in distributed database systems  
* point to different consistency models  
* internal concept of distributed database systems  
  > how they handle replication and partitioning  
* **different types of ditributed database systems and asses their features**
