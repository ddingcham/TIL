### Futures, Promises and Asynchronous Tasks  

#### Providing a **proxy entitiy** that returns the result, once available  
* **Decoupling a computation and its eventual result**  
* Promises/Futures are often used for asynchronous background tasks  
* Once a task is dispatched,  
  * the proxy entity is returned  
  * the caller's flow of execution can continue  
  * **the proxy entity is decoupled from the new computation**  
* [not available] the proxy entity either blocks or provides a notification  
  > when non-blocking  
  
#### synchronization side  
> Promises and Futures also introduce a synchronization mechanism  
* allowing to dispatch independent computations  
* but synchronize with the initial flow of control  
* once the result is requested and eventually returned  
  
#### concurrency side  
* threads for concurrency  
  * the execution of the background task is scheduled to another thread  
  * allowing the initial thread to continue execution  
* actor-based system  
  * **actor as a proxy entity** of a computation  
  * **abstracted using Futures**  
    * Sending message to another actor  
    * Awaiting eventual response  
* event-driven system  
  * eventual results are represented by events  
  * handled by associated callbacks  
  
#### When programming web applications, they can be used to decrease latency    
* **동기화된 결과를 반환하지 않고, "수행 중인 작업"을 반환 하는 컨셉**  
  > 동기화 위치에 대한 컨트롤 -> 병렬 수행 범위 제어 가능  
* **via scatter-gather pattern**  
  * scatter : dispatching multiple independent operations  
  * gather : waits for all operations to yield results  

#### ex] parallelizing database query via "scatter and gather pattern"  
> Dataflow programming provides a similar execution strategy  
> but hides the notion of futures in the implementation  
* scattering all operations as background tasks yielding proxy entities  
* gathering all results by accessing the proxy entities  
* **converting a sequence of operations into parallel execution of operations**  

### Coroutines (Fibers, Green Threads) / generalization of subroutines  
* Coroutine can suspend and resume its execution at distinct points in code  
  > while subroutine is executed sequentially and straightly  
* good primitivies for cooperative task handling  
  > as coroutine can yield execution  
* **massive parallelism of asynchronous operations such as I/O**  
  > see [chapter 4](https://github.com/ddingcham/TIL/tree/master/%EB%8F%99%EC%8B%9C%EC%84%B1/Concurrent%20Programming%20for%20Scalable%20Web%20Architectures/Web%20Server%20Architectures%20for%20High%20Concurrency)    
* low-level primitives  
  > 상위 수준의 동시성 개념 구현 시, 스레드 대신 primitive로 활용  
  > actor-based systems / event-driven platform 내부 구현에 사용되곤 함  

#### Google Go / genral-purpose  
* supproting garbage collection and synchronous message passing for concurrency  
* does not supply threads for concurrent flows of executions  
  > targeting usage scenarios similar to C/C++ by tendency  
* primitive called **goroutine** derived from coroutines  
  * goroutine : functions that are executed in parallel **with their caller and other running goroutines**  
* runtime system maps goroutines to a number of underlying threads  
  > **which might lead to truely parallel execution**  
* executed by a single thread using cooperative scheduling  
  * more powerful than conventional coroutines  
  * via synchronous message passing  
    > imply parallel execution and communicate  
    
### Channels and Synchronous Message Passing  

* Asynchronous message passing : sender can't know when a message is actually received and handled  
  > see : "Actor-based system" - asynchronous message passing  
  
* explicit message exchanging  
  > both the sender and receiver have to be ready and block  
  > while the message is getting exchanged  
  
* several simple differences between both model  
  * entity  
    * async message : entities have identities  
    * sync message : entities are anonymous  
      * with explicit & named channels for communication between entities  

#### Google Go makes heavy use of synchronous message passing  
* very similar to the way pipes are used in Unix  
* **Channels are first-level languages primitives**  
  > used for data exchange between goroutines  
* Channels are main synchronization primitive assuring that multiple goroutines meet in a mutually known state  
  
### Dataflow Programming / allowing true parallelism  
* **Defining the relations between necessary operations**  
  * 의존성들과 실행 흐름에 대한 그래프를 암시적으로 표현  
  * allowing the runtime systems to automatically **identify independent steps of operations**  
  * allowing the runtime systems to automatically **parallelize steps at runtime**  
* Via Channels, Coordination and Synchronization are hidden in the runtime system  
  * to wait for multiple input data  
  * to initiate the next steps of computation  
  * coordination and synchronization efforts are hidden due to the **declarative style**  
  
#### Application-level request handling can be defined as a flow of operations  
> help to decrease latencies
