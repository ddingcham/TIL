# Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures  
## 3. The Quest for Scalable Web Architectures  

### Introduction  
* behind the architectures that provide web applications  
* outline several technologies that have emerged to serve dynamic web content  
* more recent cloud-based architectrues  
* how these technologies have been integrated into common architectures.  
  * load-balancing  
  * established and important mechanism for scalability  
* infrastructure and services provided by popular cloud vendors  

#### generic architectural model for scalable web applications  
> focusing on concurrency.  

#### separation into the different architectural components  
* provide a clearer scalability path for each component  
* reason about particular concurrency challenges inherent to the distinct components.
