## 2. Summary  

#### Web applications designed for millions of users are faced with extraordinary challenges,  
> including the reasonable handling of **inherent parallelism** and the **profound ability to scale**

#### Concurrency is a mandatory and crucial principle when programming and implementing large-scale web apps.
> concurrent programming is a non-tribial procedure,  
> we are in need of **appropriate abstractions and usable programming models**.

#### The scalability requirement of large web architectures obliges us to think about growth from the beginning.
